 Once upon a time there was a magical place where it never rained. This place was  not Ohio. Lee and Jen were tired of living in Ohio and so they decided to leave  Ohio and never returned. They wanted to leave and be able to find a place where  it never rained because they were tired of the gray skies and tired sad  climate but they didn't quite understand what to do because the Air Force is  confusing and really didn't give them any instructions. So one day they just  hopped into their car and started driving and they kept driving and driving and  driving until they found a dry, arid, desolate landscape full of dead bones and  carcasses of animals. They decided that this was probably the place they wanted  to live because there was no water in sight and there was no cloud in the sky.  It was very big and blue but now they had a new problem. They had no water. So  they decided this was not the place either. So they decided to leave and  following their departure they found a place where it was mainly sunny and only  gray and drab on occasion. The end.
