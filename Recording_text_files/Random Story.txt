 Once upon a time, there was a magical place where it never rained. This place was not Ohio. Lee and Jen were tired of living in Ohio, and so they decided to leave Ohio and never return. They wanted to leave and be able to find a place where it never rained because they were tired of the gray skies and tired, sad climate. But they didn't quite understand what to do because the Air Force is confusing and really didn't give them any instructions. So one day they just hopped into their car and started driving, and they kept driving and driving and driving until they found a dry, arid, desolate landscape full of dead bones and carcasses of animals. They decided that this was probably the place they wanted to live because there was no water in sight, and there was no cloud in the sky. It was very big and blue. But now they had a new problem. They had no water. So they decided this was not the place either. So they decided to leave. And following their departure, they found a place where it was mainly sunny and only gray and drab on occasion. The end. They later had no water. So then they would look like a cloud in the sky to the sky. And they cleaned many of the sky, and when verschiedene times they were in the sky. That slide just dazzling at all the mess of the映er and over υp boosted by somewhere in the sky. And there were many surgeries as a worn little teacher. They put the needle on People's previous and they found a lot of them needed their 1947. So the next slide, let me Comic-Marem went back, and they took a distance. So they thought it was going on to repeat times.
